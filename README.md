# Clash Royale Bot
Simple bot for playing Clash Royale using the pyautogui python library and the BlueStacks emulator in order to play Clash Royale on a computer

The library "pyautogui" can take screenshots of the game window in order to get information about the enemies positions, the current elixir, the current cards in deck, or to detect whether the game has ended or not.
The library also allows to interact with the game in order to play the cards in the board.

The scripts to manage game input and interact with the game are made, however the game decisions and intelligence of the bot is still needs to be improved.

All the data of the cards present in the json stats file is extracted from "https://github.com/RoyaleAPI/cr-api-data"

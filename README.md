# Clash Royale Bot
Simple bot for playing Clash Royale using the pyautogui python library and the BlueStacks emulator in order to play Clash Royale on a computer

The library "pyautogui" can take screenshots of the game window in order to get information about the enemies positions, the current elixir, the current cards in deck, or to detect wether the game has ended or not.
The library also allow us to interact with the game in order to play the cards of our deck.


All the card data present in the json stats file is from "https://github.com/RoyaleAPI/cr-api-data"
